---General---
bTools is a collection of tools with the primary goal of making common unity tasks
faster and more ergonomic. Quick buttons, shortcuts, windows to group settings etc...

bTools places a component (bObjectData) on all GameObjects to store data about them.
It's code is editor-only, but feel free to remove this restriction or add more data to it.

Please use the uninstall wizard if you wish to remove bTools from your project,
it will remove preprocessor defines as well as all instances of bObjectData for you.
Make sure to backup first !
